introduction to security tools and technologies
  
module overview and objectives 02/83
module overview
this module describes technologies such as vpns, firewalls, and ids that enable secure communication over insecure
channels such as the internet. vpns use ipsec, tls, and other measures to provide authentication, privacy, and data
integrity, whereas firewalls provide a single point of access into the network. ids acts as an additional layer of defense
and can help detect and protect against outside attacks.
topics covered in this module:
+ virtual private network (vpn)
+ firewalls
+ intrusion detection systems (ids)
module objectives
after completing this module, you will be able to:
* list the tools and technologies available to create more secure systems.
+ use the available tools and technologies to obtain a particular level of security assurance,introduction to security tools and technologies

this module describes technologies such as vpns, firewalls, and ids that enable secure communication over insecure
channels such as the internet. vpns use ipsec, tls, and other measures to provide authentication, privacy, and data
integrity, whereas firewalls provide a single point of access into the network. ids acts as an additional layer of defense
and can help detect and protect against outside attacks.
topics covered in this module:
+ virtual private network (vpn)
+ firewalls
+ intrusion detection systems (ids)
module objectives
after completing this module, you will be able to:
* list the tools and technologies available to create more secure systems.
+ use the available tools and technologies to obtain a particular level of security assurance,introduction to security tools and technologies
