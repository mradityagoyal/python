disadvantages of software-based vpns
+ are generally harder to manage than hardware-based solutions.
+ require familiarity with the host operating system, the application itself, and the appropriate security mechanisms.
+ may require changes to routing tables and network addressing schemes
+ because the data stream is encrypted from end-to-end, hardware-based content-fitering solutions will not work.introduction to security tools and technolo:
