firewalls: uses 12/83
packet filtering firewalls are used to filter packets based on a combination of packet features. for example,
you can configure this firewall to drop the packets with destination port 23, which is used for telnet. the
firewall can use any combination of ip/udp/tcp header information to find a packet's source and
destination address, and then use that information to determine how to treat the packet.introduction to security tools and technolo:
