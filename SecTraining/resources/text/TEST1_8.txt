firewalls (cont.) 10/83
you can think of a firewall as a castle with a drawbridge. it provides a single point of access into the network, which has both positive and negative aspects.
although you've reduced the attack surface, you've also identified important services for an attacker. so instead of spending time on a long list of different ports,
the attacker can focus on the open ports and the services related to them.
‘some firewalls are hardware-based; for example, some routers include a firewall.
other firewalls are software-based. the following table lists examples of firewalls used with different operating systems:

you can think of a firewall as a castle with a drawbridge. it provides a single point of access into the network, which has both positive and negative aspects.
although you've reduced the attack surface, you've also identified important services for an attacker. so instead of spending time on a long list of different ports,
the attacker can focus on the open ports and the services related to them.
‘some firewalls are hardware-based; for example, some routers include a firewall.
