firewalls: limitations (cont.)
remember the following points when deploying firewalls. a firewall:
+ is only the first line of perimeter defense
+ is not acomplete security solution
* cannot prevent:
* complexity mismanagement
+ input validation attacks
+ sql injection
http session hijacking
impersonation
other application vulnerabilities
although firewalls have limitations, you should never deploy a network without one. without a firewall, you
would be under a constant attack.introduction to security tools and technolo:

although firewalls have limitations, you should never deploy a network without one. without a firewall, you
would be under a constant attack.introduction to security tools and technolo:
