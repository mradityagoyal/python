vpn systems are divided into three broad categories:
+ hardware-based vpn systems: these systems usually use encrypting routers.
+ firewall-based vpn systems: these systems take advantage of the firewall's security mechanisms, including restricting access to the internal network.
+ software-based vpn systems: these are ideal when both endpoints of the vpn are not controlled by the same organization.introduction to security tools and technolo:

vpn systems are divided into three broad categories:
+ hardware-based vpn systems: these systems usually use encrypting routers.
+ firewall-based vpn systems: these systems take advantage of the firewall's security mechanisms, including restricting access to the internal network.
