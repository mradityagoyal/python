avpn is a private network constructed across a public network. it implements security measures that encrypt
data before sending it and decrypt it at the receiving end. you can add additional security by tunneling, in
which you encrypt originating and receiving network header information as well.
benefits of vpns:
+ extended geographic connectivity
+ simplified network topology
+ lower operational cost compared to traditional wan
for example, an organization that has two offices at different locations, each with a local network behind a
firewall, could set up a vpn. an encrypted tunnel connects these networks together, allowing them to share
resources. this tunnel runs over the public internet and is reasonably easy to deploy, requiring no additional
infrastructure expenditure.vpn and its benefits

avpn is a private network constructed across a public network. it implements security measures that encrypt
data before sending it and decrypt it at the receiving end. you can add additional security by tunneling, in
which you encrypt originating and receiving network header information as well.
benefits of vpns:
+ extended geographic connectivity
+ simplified network topology
+ lower operational cost compared to traditional wan
