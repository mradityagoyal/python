firewalls
firewalls attempt to secure the network by reducing the number of services that are exposed to the internet.
many services that are running on a server don't need to be publicly accessible,
for example, internally, you may have a remote desktop connected to windows server, but you may not want
outsiders to have access to this internal server through the remote desktop service. you can use a firewall to

for example, internally, you may have a remote desktop connected to windows server, but you may not want
outsiders to have access to this internal server through the remote desktop service. you can use a firewall to
solve this problem.introduction to security tools and technolo:
