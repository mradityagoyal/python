firewalls: limitations 16/83
‘one of the major limitations of firewalls is that they allow most common traffic to pass through. for example,
http is the most commonly allowed protocol through enterprise firewalls. as a result, web traffic is perceived
e as friendly, leaving an open door for malicious users.
when you deploy a firewall with all of the ports closed, the system is very secure. however, as soon as you
start using various services, like remote desktop, http, ssh, pop, imap, and smtp, you end up with more
open ports than closed ones. this reduces the effectiveness of the firewall
in today's world, firewalls are like swiss cheese.

‘one of the major limitations of firewalls is that they allow most common traffic to pass through. for example,
http is the most commonly allowed protocol through enterprise firewalls. as a result, web traffic is perceived

when you deploy a firewall with all of the ports closed, the system is very secure. however, as soon as you

‘one of the major limitations of firewalls is that they allow most common traffic to pass through. for example,
http is the most commonly allowed protocol through enterprise firewalls. as a result, web traffic is perceived
e as friendly, leaving an open door for malicious users.
when you deploy a firewall with all of the ports closed, the system is very secure. however, as soon as you
start using various services, like remote desktop, http, ssh, pop, imap, and smtp, you end up with more
