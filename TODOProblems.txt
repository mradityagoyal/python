"""
The set [1,2,3,...,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for n = 3:

"123"
"132"
"213"
"231"
"312"
"321"
Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.

https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/description/
Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.

Example:

Given this linked list: 1->2->3->4->5

For k = 2, you should return: 2->1->4->3->5

For k = 3, you should return: 3->2->1->4->5

Note:

Only constant extra memory is allowed.
You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.

https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-subarray-with-sum-at-least-k/description/
Return the length of the shortest, non-empty, contiguous subarray of A with sum at least K.

If there is no non-empty subarray with sum at least K, return -1.



Example 1:

Input: A = [1], K = 1
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: A = [1,2], K = 4
Output: -1
Example 3:

Input: A = [2,-1,2], K = 3
Output: 3


https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node-ii/description/

Given a binary tree

struct TreeLinkNode {
  TreeLinkNode *left;
  TreeLinkNode *right;
  TreeLinkNode *next;
}
Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.

Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.

Note:

You may only use constant extra space.
Recursive approach is fine, implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.

https://leetcode.com/problems/queue-reconstruction-by-height/description/
Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers (h, k), where h is the height of the person and k is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to h. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.

Note:
The number of people is less than 1,100.


Example

Input:
[[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]

Output:
[[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]


https://leetcode.com/problems/loud-and-rich/description/
In a group of N people (labelled 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1), each person has different amounts of money, and different levels of quietness.

For convenience, we'll call the person with label x, simply "person x".

We'll say that richer[i] = [x, y] if person x definitely has more money than person y.  Note that richer may only be a subset of valid observations.

Also, we'll say quiet[x] = q if person x has quietness q.

Now, return answer, where answer[x] = y if y is the least quiet person (that is, the person y with the smallest value of quiet[y]), among all people who definitely have equal to or more money than person x.



Example 1:

Input: richer = [[1,0],[2,1],[3,1],[3,7],[4,3],[5,3],[6,3]], quiet = [3,2,5,4,6,1,7,0]
Output: [5,5,2,5,4,5,6,7]
Explanation:
answer[0] = 5.
Person 5 has more money than 3, which has more money than 1, which has more money than 0.
The only person who is quieter (has lower quiet[x]) is person 7, but
it isn't clear if they have more money than person 0.

answer[7] = 7.
Among all people that definitely have equal to or more money than person 7
(which could be persons 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7), the person who is the quietest (has lower quiet[x])
is person 7.

The other answers can be filled out with similar reasoning.


https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-a-multilevel-doubly-linked-list/description/
You are given a doubly linked list which in addition to the next and previous pointers, it could have a child pointer, which may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list. These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure, as shown in the example below.

Flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. You are given the head of the first level of the list.

Example:

Input:
 1---2---3---4---5---6--NULL
         |
         7---8---9---10--NULL
             |
             11--12--NULL

Output:
1-2-3-7-8-11-12-9-10-4-5-6-NULL
Explanation for the above example:

Given the following multilevel doubly linked list:



We should return the following flattened doubly linked list:
