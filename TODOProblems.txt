"""
The set [1,2,3,...,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for n = 3:

"123"
"132"
"213"
"231"
"312"
"321"
Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.

https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/description/
Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.

Example:

Given this linked list: 1->2->3->4->5

For k = 2, you should return: 2->1->4->3->5

For k = 3, you should return: 3->2->1->4->5

Note:

Only constant extra memory is allowed.
You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.

https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-subarray-with-sum-at-least-k/description/
Return the length of the shortest, non-empty, contiguous subarray of A with sum at least K.

If there is no non-empty subarray with sum at least K, return -1.



Example 1:

Input: A = [1], K = 1
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: A = [1,2], K = 4
Output: -1
Example 3:

Input: A = [2,-1,2], K = 3
Output: 3
