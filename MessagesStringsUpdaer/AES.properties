### --------------------------------------- About these strings ---------------------------------------
### This file should be used for errors - all errors have error codes, causes (todo) and resolutions (todo)
### This file, in contrast to internal_error_strings, is intended for end-user-visible errors
### Note, per https://confluence.oraclecorp.com/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=38883321, that pre-save validations are not errors
### Keys in this file map to AEK.java, and LocalizedException and all derived subclasses take AEK keys
